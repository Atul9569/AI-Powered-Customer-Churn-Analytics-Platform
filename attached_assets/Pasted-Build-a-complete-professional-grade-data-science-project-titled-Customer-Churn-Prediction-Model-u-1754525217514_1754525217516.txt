Build a complete, professional-grade data science project titled "Customer Churn Prediction Model" using Python.

Requirements:

ðŸ“‚ Project Structure:

README.md with project overview, objective, tech stack, results, and business impact

notebooks/ folder containing Jupyter notebook with all steps (EDA â†’ preprocessing â†’ modeling â†’ evaluation)

src/ folder with modular Python scripts for data cleaning, model training, and evaluation

data/ folder with sample dataset (can use Telco Customer Churn dataset)

ðŸ“Š Data Analysis & Preprocessing:

Load and describe the dataset (use Pandas)

Handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers

Encode categorical features using appropriate techniques

Apply feature engineering (create new variables, feature selection, scaling)

ðŸ¤– Modeling:

Train at least 3 models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost

Use ensemble method (XGBoost) for final model

Split dataset using train-test split (80-20)

Optimize model with GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV

Achieve target accuracy â‰¥ 89%

ðŸ“ˆ Evaluation:

Evaluate using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC

Show confusion matrix and classification report

Plot ROC Curve and Feature Importance chart

ðŸ§  Explainability:

Use SHAP or Permutation Importance to explain top contributing features

ðŸ’¼ Business Insights:

Analyze which factors contribute most to churn

Provide 3 actionable recommendations to reduce churn

ðŸ’» Technologies:

Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib/Seaborn

ðŸ“¤ Deployment (Optional):

Export trained model with joblib or pickle

Create a basic CLI or Streamlit UI to predict churn on new input

Output everything in a GitHub-ready format, including clear markdowns, comments, visualizations, and folder structure.

ðŸ§  Bonus Tips:
Use the Telco Customer Churn dataset (Kaggle) or generate mock data with realistic features: tenure, contract type, monthly charges, etc.

Include a requirements.txt file so others can install dependencies.

Add a demo video or screenshots in the README if possible.
